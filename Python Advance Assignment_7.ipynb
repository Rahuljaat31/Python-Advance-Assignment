When we use a with statement for file reading, there is no need for programmer to explicitly take care of activities like resource deallocation and file closing by using file.close() method. The with statement itself ensures proper acquisition and release of resources. This avoids triggering of exceptions if file closing is unknowingly forgotten in the code execution.\n",
