So, 'object' and 'instance' are the same thing, but the word 'instance' indicates the relationship of an object to its class. a single object of a class can access multille functions defiend in the class in form of ine to many relationships."

For example, if we write type(obj) then Python will return an object which represents the type of obj. Using reflection, we can write one recursive reverse function that will work for strings, lists, and any other sequence that supports slicing and concatenation. If an obj is a reference to a string, then Python will return the str type object."

    "Ans.12 init method is basically used for constructing the object variables meaning, initialisation of object variables happen, where the class attributes gets the values from the class instance where the values are stored. So when we want to inherit the attributes/variables of the class then we need to inherit the init method also. This implies that whatever the variables were initialise in the parent class, those will also get initialise in the subclass. We uses super() method in order to call the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can customise the behaviour of the subclass by declaring some new other attributes and initialising them. However these new attributes will only get accessed by the subclass object. We could use overridding technique also for changing the behaviour of the init method without defining it separately inside the subclass"
