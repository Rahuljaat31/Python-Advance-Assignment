    "\n",
    "Ans.1 The Main difference between Greedy and Non Greedy Match Syntax is that the Greedy Match will try to match as many repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible Whereas the Non Greedy Match will try to match as few repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible so that it still can match the pattern in the given string."

If one lookahead is more likely to fail than the other two, it makes little sense to place it in third position and expend a lot of energy checking the first two conditions. Make it first, so that if we're going to fail, we fail earlyâ€”an application of the design to fail principle from the regex style guide."
